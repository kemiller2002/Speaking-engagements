# Speaker Bio

**Kevin Miller is a systems architect, engineering leader, and diagnostic specialist with over 25 years of experience building and scaling high-impact technology organizations.** Known for his ability to uncover root-cause failure patterns in complex systems, Kevin blends engineering, psychology, and decision-science to help teams improve reliability, clarity, and organizational performance.

He has led distributed engineering teams across financial, nonprofit, and consumer sectors; redesigned multi-million-dollar platforms; and created HelixNote, an AI-powered diagnostic and documentation framework used in technical forensics, compliance investigations, and modernization projects. Kevin’s career spans architecture, DevOps transformation, accessibility engineering, AI-assisted analysis, and forensic investigation—including work with donor-advised funds, structural materials testing, and large-scale data migration.

A former Microsoft MVP, published speaker, and trained chocolatier, Kevin brings a rare combination of deep technical insight, creativity, and human-centered storytelling. His talks help leaders and engineers understand how complex systems behave—and how to make them behave better.
