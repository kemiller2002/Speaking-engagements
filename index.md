# Speaking

I help engineering leaders, architects, SREs, and executives understand how complex systems really behave—and what to do when they don’t.

I speak about:

- Diagnosing failures across software, organizations, and real-world systems  
- Architecture as constraints (not just diagrams)  
- Postmortems that actually change behavior  
- Incentives, outages, and why everything breaks at 2 A.M.  
- Decision-making and clarity under chaos
